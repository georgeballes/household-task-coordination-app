Household Task Coordination App

I've designed and developed a complete iPhone app that helps partners and friends coordinate household tasks like dinner preparation, laundry scheduling, and other chores. The app provides clear visibility into who is responsible for which tasks and when, simplifying household management.

ðŸš€ Key Features

User Management: Create profiles for all household members.

Task Assignment: Clearly assign tasks to specific individuals.

Task Scheduling: Coordinate timing for shared resources (e.g., laundry machines).

Task Filtering: View all tasks, only your tasks, or tasks assigned to others.

Task Reassignment: Easily transfer responsibilities between household members.

Calendar View: See all scheduled tasks in a clear monthly calendar.

Completion Tracking: Mark tasks as complete and track household contributions.

ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

The app is built using React Native with Expo, offering:

Cross-platform compatibility: Initially designed for iPhone with potential expansion to Android.

Native-like experience: Smooth and responsive interactions.

Efficient State Management: Consistent and performant across screens.

Intuitive Navigation: Seamless user experience between different features.
