# household-task-coordination-app
I've designed and developed a complete iPhone app that helps partners and friends coordinate household tasks like dinner preparation, laundry scheduling, and other chores. The app provides clear visibility of who is responsible for which tasks and when, making household management much simpler.


Key Features
User Management: Create profiles for all household members
Task Assignment: Clearly assign tasks to specific people
Task Scheduling: Coordinate timing for shared resources (like laundry machines)
Task Filtering: View all tasks, just your tasks, or tasks assigned to others
Task Reassignment: Easily transfer responsibilities between household members
Calendar View: See all scheduled tasks in a monthly calendar
Completion Tracking: Mark tasks as complete and track household contributions
Technical Implementation
The app is built using React Native with Expo, providing:
Cross-platform compatibility (can be expanded to Android later)
Smooth, native-feeling user experience
Efficient state management across all screens
Intuitive navigation between features
